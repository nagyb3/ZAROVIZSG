Pure functions always produce the same result when given the same parameter meaning the return value only depends on the input. Also, they do not have any side-effect and immutability applies that there wonâ€™t be any change in the state. Pure functions do not communicate with the outside world. For example, mathematical functions like pow, abs, sqrt, etc. are examples of pure functions.
